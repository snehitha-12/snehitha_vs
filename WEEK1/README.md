# [RTL Design And Synthesis Workshop Using Sky130](https://www.vlsisystemdesign.com/rtl-design-using-verilog-with-sky130-technology/)


Welcome to the **RTL Workshop**, a hands-on learning series focused on Verilog RTL design, simulation, synthesis, and digital circuit optimization. This repository is structured into multiple days, each with its own practical labs, code examples, and explanations.

## About This Workshop

This workshop is intended for students, hobbyists, and engineers who want to learn about:

- Verilog RTL design and simulation
- Using Icarus Verilog and GTKWave for simulation and waveform analysis
- Logic synthesis using Yosys and the SKY130 open-source PDK
- Key digital design concepts: testbenches, timing libraries, D flip-flop coding styles, and optimization techniques

---

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of digital logic (gates, flip-flops, multiplexers, etc.)
- Familiarity with Linux shell commands
- A Linux environment (or WSL on Windows/macOS)
- Tools: `git`, `iverilog`, `gtkwave`, `yosys`, and a text editor

---

## Workshop Structure

The workshop is organized by day, each with a dedicated folder and README:

- [Day 1: Introduction to Verilog RTL Design & Synthesis](DAY1/README.md)
- [Day 2: Timing Libraries, Synthesis Approaches, and Efficient Flip-Flop Coding](DAY2/README.md)
- [Day 3: Combinational and Sequential Optimization](DAY3/README.md)
- [Day 4: Gate-Level Simulation (GLS), Blocking vs. Non-Blocking in Verilog, and Synthesis-Simulation Mismatch ](DAY4/README.md)
- [Day 5: Optimization in Synthesis ](DAY5/README.md)

Each dayâ€™s README includes:
- Clear explanations of the dayâ€™s concepts
- Step-by-step practical labs with code and screenshots
- Tips and best practices for RTL design
